## Brief explanation

In this project, I have built a CRM web app that maintains the details of customers. To use the app, start by signing up and logging in as an admin. Afterward, you can effectively manage customer details by adding new customers, updating existing records, and deleting customer information.

To enable the chat features between admin and customers, it's important to note that customers must be added by the admin within the platform. Furthermore, customers should complete the registration process on the platform to fully access and participate in chat conversations. This dual-step process ensures a secure and interactive communication environment between the admin and registered customers.

# Key features
1. authentication for both admin and customers
2. interactive UI for easy management of customers data
3. chat between admin and customer
4. email can be send to customer through this plateform

# UI of the platform
